abstract: This paper proposes a new chaotic system based on two parameters. The proposed chaotic system has good chaotic characteristics, and it can be shown that the chaotic system is suitable for image encryption through a variety of simulation experiments. Based on this system, we propose a new image encryption algorithm. The algorithm uses nonlinear chaotic sequences for row, column, and diagonal scrambling and diffusion in two directions. When scrambling, the diffusion matrix generated by the chaotic system is dynamically upset, and the image scrambling direction is determined by the relative coordinates of multiple chaotic systems. When diffusing, two matrices are used to change the pixel value：one is the matrix processed by scrambling, and the other is the matrix generated by the truth table. The resulting encrypted image is affected by both the chaotic system and the truth table rules. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the image encrypted by this algorithm has high security.
